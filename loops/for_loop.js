// for_loop.js
/* A for loop contains three expressions separated by ;
   inside the parentheses:
  
   an initialization starts the loop and can
   Also be used to declare the iterator variable.

   A stopping condition is the condition that the
   iterator variable is evaluated againstâ€” if the
   condition evaluates to true the code block will
   run, and if it evaluates to false the code will
   stop.

   An iteration statement is used to update the
   iterator variable on each loop. */
